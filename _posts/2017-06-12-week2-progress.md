Week 2 is over and I prototyped the core of the algorithm computing the polynomial representing isotope distribution of an element in a formula. E.g for the formula c10h10 it can polynomial id of c10 and the id of h10 can be computed seperately. I am long way from reaching pre-evaluation goal, making it actually work but i feel i am ahead of the schedule.

My work from the previous week really paid off. Reading the Midas paper the rest of the implementation was straightforward. I implemented the algorithm in less than 200 lines of code. I was quite happy with the results.
